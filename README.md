TECHNOLOGY USED
------------------

1. Java Spring boot Framework
   -The choice of the above framework was irresistible since Spring Boot
   comes without of the box dependency management and it takes care of both creating and destroying an object.
   -This reduces boilerplate code hence maintaing a clean, well organized easily scalable code base.
   -Java Spring boot is also one of the best frameworks that enable quick development and shipping of enterprise APIs to
   the market

2. Lombok
   -This is a tool that is very much important in reducing boilerplate code hence reducing the Turnaround time
   of development through annotations that do the heavy lifting behind the scenes. e.g @Getter, @Setter, @ToString
   Lombok is also very important in logging.

3. Java Persistence API
   -This library is the go between the business logic and the database layer. It takes care of database queries;

4. Postgresql
   -This was the  DBMS chosen due to its scalability and ease of use

5. Mockito - For writing unit tests and mocking data

6. Docker - For packaging the application.()

7. Java 8 and above features
- CompletableFuture API - this was necesary to perform parallel operations on different threads and receive a
  response once a thread is done. That is, multithreading.
  -Use of Record instead of a class was handy especially to reduce boilerplate code through creating constructors
- Java Streams API - Declarative approach of handling lists
  -Functional Programming For proper code presentation
- Lambda expressions

SET UP INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------
1. Apache Kafka message broker - set up using Confluence Cloud Kafka broker.
   -This was to avoid the overhead that comes with maintaining a local Kafka message broker as
   it requires a lot of resources
- Configs set up in the application.properties file

2. Run the application and restore the database within the root folder of the project.

3. Go to http://localhost:8085/loan_management/swagger-ui.html to test the endpoints
